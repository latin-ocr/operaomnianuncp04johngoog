PREFACE.

Nnxrtohis Epistolary writings, the most important
work of our authoris his polycraticus, contained in
this and the following volumes. The full title of the
work is Ponrcnarrcus, sine de aupes Castalium et
vestigiis philosophorum.

lt appears to be doubtful lor what reason the name
Polycraticus was chosen, for the etymology of that
word gives no indication whatever of the nature or
subject of his work. The treatise is dirided into
eight books, to which is prefixed s poetical intro·
duction or prologue entitled Entheticns, in which the
author, dedicating his work to Becket, then Chaucellor
and afterwards Archbisbop, remarks, that nearly all
mankind were engaged in pursnit ol those trifles
against which his work was airned.

It appears from the Peterborough Chronicle ⁸, that
this work was completod in 1156, though it may have
been written at different timos before that date, and
rerised hy its author at a later period.

It has been often printed, alter collation with
different MSS. For the present edition the text has
